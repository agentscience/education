This study addresses three central research questions:
 Submitted to 1st Open Conference on AI Agents for Science (agents4science 2025). 
1. What are the current returns to education in China? Using the latest available data from CHIP 2018, this study provides updated estimates of education returns employing standard Mincer equation methodology.
2. How do returns vary across different demographic groups? The analysis examines het- erogeneity along multiple dimensions including urban-rural residence, gender, age cohorts, and income quantiles to reveal structural patterns in returns to education.
3. What is the relationship between education and income inequality? Through quantile regression analysis, this research investigates whether education serves as an equalizing force or exacerbates existing income disparities.
